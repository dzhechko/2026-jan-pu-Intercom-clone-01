# Pre-Flight Quality Checklist — Claude Code Artifacts

> Deterministic Layer 0 checks. Run before any LLM evaluation. Free, fast, catches ~60% of issues.
> Pass rate threshold: **≥ 80%** to proceed to Layer 1/2 evaluation.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Identify artifact type (Skill / Command / Rule / Agent Template / Research Artifact)
2. Run **Universal Checks** (apply to all types)
3. Run the **type-specific section**
4. Count: `pass_rate = passed / total_applicable`
5. If `pass_rate < 0.80` → return to BUILD phase, fix issues, re-check

**Auto-fixable items** (marked `YES`) can be fixed programmatically without human review.
**Non-auto-fixable items** (marked `NO`) require human or LLM-assisted review.

## Scoring Summary

### Calculation

```
total_applicable  = Universal (12) + type-specific checks
passed            = count of checks that PASS
pass_rate         = passed / total_applicable
```

### Thresholds

| Pass Rate | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 90% | EXCELLENT | Proceed to Layer 1/2 with high confidence |
| 80% – 89% | PASS | Proceed to Layer 1/2 evaluation |
| 60% – 79% | CONDITIONAL | Fix auto-fixable items, re-check before Layer 1 |
| < 60% | FAIL | Return to BUILD phase — do not evaluate yet |

### Score Report Format

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LAYER 0 PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
Artifact: <name> (<type>)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Universal checks:       X / 12
Type-specific checks:   X / N
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:                  X / (12+N)
Pass rate:              XX%
Status:                 PASS | FAIL | CONDITIONAL

Failed checks:
  - [ID] Description of failure
  - [ID] Description of failure
  (auto-fixable marked with *)

Verdict: [PROCEED TO LAYER 1] | [FIX AND RE-CHECK] | [RETURN TO BUILD]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Maintenance Notes

- This checklist is **domain-agnostic** and applies to any IT project using the Claude Code skill/command/rule/agent architecture.
- When adding new artifact types, add a new section following the same table format (ID / Check / Pass Criteria / Fail Criteria / Auto-fixable).
- Review and update thresholds after every 50 evaluations to calibrate against real-world pass rates.
- Auto-fixable items should be addressed by the BUILD module before outputting an artifact.
