> Multi-agent evaluation and prompt optimization system for Claude Code artifacts.

## Overview

BTO is a 3-module pipeline for creating, evaluating, and optimizing Claude Code skills, commands, rules, and agents. It combines structured generation, multi-agent LLM judging, and evolutionary prompt optimization.

## Modules

| Module | Purpose | Command | Agent Pattern |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **BUILD** | Generate skill/command from requirements | `/bto-build` | Single agent + explore |
| **TEST** | Multi-agent evaluation with judge panel | `/bto-test` | 3 parallel judges |
| **OPTIMIZE** | Evolutionary prompt optimization | `/bto-optimize` | N parallel workers |

## Quick Start

```
/bto [skill-path]              — Full pipeline (build → test → optimize)
/bto-build [description]       — Generate a new skill or command
/bto-test [path]               — Evaluate an existing artifact
/bto-optimize [path]           — Optimize prompts in a skill
```

## Module 1: BUILD

**Goal:** Generate complete, production-quality Claude Code skills/commands from natural language requirements.

### Protocol

1. **Requirements Clarification** — Load `explore` skill to clarify:
   - What artifact type? (skill / command / rule / agent template)
   - Domain and context
   - Input/output expectations
   - Quality criteria
   - Reference examples (optional)

2. **Template Selection** — Based on artifact type:
   - **Skill:** SKILL.md + modules/ + references/ + examples/
   - **Command:** Single .md file with parameter handling
   - **Rule:** Single .md with detection patterns and fixes
   - **Agent template:** Single .md with agent config

3. **Generation** — Structured generation following conventions:
   - Load `references/quality-checklist.md` for validation criteria
   - Generate with proper sections, headers, formatting
   - Include anti-patterns section
   - Include at least one reference and one example

4. **Self-Review** — Before output:
   - Check against quality checklist (Layer 0)
   - Verify no empty sections
   - Verify all cross-references resolve
   - Verify naming conventions match (`file-conventions` rule)

### BUILD Modes

| Mode | When | Agents | Time |
|------|------|--------|------|
| QUICK | Simple artifact, clear requirements | 1 | ~2 min |
| DEEP | Complex skill, unclear requirements | 1 + explore | ~5 min |

### Output Structure (Skill)

```
.claude/skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md                 ← Main orchestrator
├── modules/                 ← Detailed protocols per module
│   └── <module-name>.md
├── references/              ← Supporting materials
│   └── <reference-name>.md
└── examples/                ← Few-shot examples
    └── <example-name>.md
```

### Anti-Patterns (BUILD)

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Generic skill without domain context | Add specific domain constraints and examples |
| Missing references directory | Always include at least one reference |
| No examples | Add at least one few-shot example |
| Over-scoped skill | Split into modules, keep SKILL.md as orchestrator |
| Copy-pasting from other skills | Adapt, don't copy — each skill is unique |

## Module 2: TEST

**Goal:** Evaluate any Claude Code artifact using deterministic checks + multi-agent LLM judging.

### Evaluation Layers

```
Layer 0: Deterministic Pre-checks     ← Fast, free, catches 60% of issues
Layer 1: Single LLM Judge             ← Quick spot-check (model: haiku)
Layer 2: Full Judge Panel (3 agents)  ← Comprehensive evaluation (model: sonnet)
Meta-Judge: Disagreement Resolution   ← Only if judges disagree >3 points
```

### Layer 0: Deterministic Pre-checks

Run BEFORE spawning any LLM agents. Fast and free.

**For Skills:**
- [ ] SKILL.md exists and is non-empty
- [ ] Has `# Title` as first heading
- [ ] Has `## Overview` section
- [ ] Has `## Anti-Patterns` section
- [ ] All referenced modules exist in modules/
- [ ] All referenced references exist in references/
- [ ] No empty sections (heading followed immediately by another heading)
- [ ] File size: 1KB < size < 50KB per file
- [ ] Total skill directory: < 200KB

**For Commands:**
- [ ] Has `$ARGUMENTS` parameter reference
- [ ] Has checkpoint protocol
- [ ] Has skill loading instruction (Read .claude/skills/...)
- [ ] File size: 500B < size < 20KB

**For Rules:**
- [ ] Has table or list of patterns
- [ ] Has detection signals and fixes
- [ ] File size: 200B < size < 10KB

**Scoring:** Pass/Fail per check → aggregate pass rate (must be ≥80% to proceed)

### Layer 1: Single LLM Judge (Quick Mode)

Use when: fast feedback needed, or evaluating many artifacts in batch.

**Model:** haiku (cost-optimized)

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
You are a Claude Code artifact evaluator. Rate the following {artifact_type}
on these dimensions (1-10 each):

1. CLARITY — Are instructions unambiguous?
2. COMPLETENESS — Are all necessary sections present?
3. ACTIONABILITY — Can Claude follow these instructions to produce output?
4. QUALITY — Is the content well-structured and professional?
5. ANTI-PATTERNS — Does it avoid known anti-patterns?

Provide: score per dimension, brief justification, top 3 improvement suggestions.
```

**Threshold:** Average ≥ 7.0 to pass

### Layer 2: Full Judge Panel (3 Agents)

Use when: thorough evaluation needed, or artifact is critical.

**Architecture:** 3 parallel agents, each with a different perspective.

Load rubrics from `references/judge-rubrics.md`.

| Judge | Role | Focus | Model |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Agent 1 | Domain Expert | Accuracy, depth, methodology, domain fit | sonnet |
| Agent 2 | Critic | Gaps, weaknesses, anti-patterns, edge cases | sonnet |
| Agent 3 | Completeness Auditor | Structure, coverage, cross-references, actionability | sonnet |

**Each judge scores independently on 5 dimensions (1-10):**
1. METHODOLOGY — Is the approach sound and well-structured?
2. DEPTH — Is the content thorough enough for the task?
3. CORRECTNESS — Are claims accurate and instructions valid?
4. USABILITY — Can a user/agent effectively use this artifact?
5. ROBUSTNESS — Does it handle edge cases and failure modes?

**Aggregation:**
- Weighted average: Expert (0.4) + Critic (0.3) + Auditor (0.3)
- Per-dimension and overall score
- Flag if any dimension has range > 3 across judges

### Meta-Judge: Disagreement Resolution

**Trigger:** Any dimension where max - min > 3 across judges.

**Action:**
1. Present all three evaluations to a single opus-level agent
2. Ask for reconciled score with explicit reasoning
3. Flag for human review if still unresolvable

### Output: Evaluation Report

See `examples/sample-eval-report.md` for format.

## Module 3: OPTIMIZE

**Goal:** Improve Claude Code artifacts through evolutionary prompt optimization.

### Protocol

1. **Baseline** — Evaluate current artifact with TEST (Layer 2)
2. **Generate Variants** — Create N=5 variants using mutation strategies
3. **Evaluate** — Run TEST (Layer 1) on each variant
4. **Select + Crossover** — Top 2 → generate 3 new variants
5. **Repeat** — 3 rounds total (15 evaluations)
6. **Output** — Best variant + before/after delta + changelog

### Mutation Strategies

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rephrase** | Reword instructions for clarity | Low CLARITY score |
| **Restructure** | Reorganize sections and flow | Low USABILITY score |
| **Add Constraints** | Add guardrails and edge cases | Low ROBUSTNESS score |
| **Simplify** | Remove redundancy, tighten language | Over-engineered artifact |
| **Specialize** | Add domain-specific context | Low DEPTH score |

### Optimization Loop

```
Round 1: 5 variants × Layer 1 eval → Select top 2
Round 2: top 2 crossover → 3 new variants × Layer 1 eval → Select top 2
Round 3: top 2 crossover → 3 new variants × Layer 2 eval → Final selection
```

### Cost Optimization

| Operation | Model | Est. Cost |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Variant generation | default (opus) | Creative work |
| Layer 1 evaluation | haiku | Cheap, fast |
| Layer 2 evaluation | sonnet | Moderate, thorough |
| Meta-judge | default (opus) | Only on disagreement |

### Anti-Patterns (OPTIMIZE)

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Overfitting to one metric | Balance all 5 dimensions equally |
| Losing generality | Check original use cases still work |
| Infinite optimization loop | Hard cap at 3 rounds |
| Optimizing already-good artifacts | Only optimize if baseline < 8.0 |
| Changing artifact semantics | Preserve original intent and scope |
