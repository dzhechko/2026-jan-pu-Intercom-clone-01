## Layer 1: Single LLM Judge (Quick Mode)

**Model:** claude-haiku (cost-optimized)
**Purpose:** Rapid spot-check before committing to full 3-judge panel

**Judge Prompt Used:**
```
You are a Claude Code artifact evaluator. Rate the skill at the provided path
on 5 dimensions (1-10 each). Provide a score, one-sentence justification,
and top 3 improvement suggestions. Artifact type: Skill.
```

### Layer 1 Scores

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| CLARITY | 7 | Instructions are mostly clear but the validation protocol section has ambiguous branching logic at step 4 |
| COMPLETENESS | 6 | Missing example file and one broken reference significantly reduce perceived completeness |
| ACTIONABILITY | 7 | Core happy path is followable; failure paths are underspecified |
| QUALITY | 7 | Well-structured with good use of tables; prose in modules could be tighter |
| ANTI-PATTERNS | 8 | Anti-patterns section is thorough with 6 patterns, each with signals and fixes |

**Layer 1 Average: 7.0**
**Threshold: 7.0**
**Status: BORDERLINE PASS — proceed to Layer 2 for definitive evaluation**

**Layer 1 Top 3 Suggestions:**
1. Add at least one complete worked example showing a real ETL schema being validated end-to-end
2. Fix the broken `schema-types.md` reference or remove the link
3. Clarify the branching logic in step 4 of the validation protocol (what happens if schema is partially valid?)

---

## Layer 2: Full Judge Panel (3 Agents)

**Models:** claude-sonnet (all 3 judges)
**Rubric source:** `references/judge-rubrics.md`
**Execution:** Parallel (all 3 judges ran simultaneously)
**Aggregation:** Weighted average — Expert 0.4 / Critic 0.3 / Auditor 0.3

---

### Judge 1: Domain Expert

**Role:** Evaluates accuracy, depth, methodology, and domain fit.
**Calibration:** Balanced — scores represent genuine quality assessment.

| Dimension | Score | Expert Commentary |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| METHODOLOGY | 8 | The validation protocol follows a logical sequence: schema → types → constraints → relationships. The hierarchical validation approach is sound for ETL contexts. |
| DEPTH | 6 | Covers the primary validation scenarios (schema drift, type mismatches, null handling) but misses temporal consistency checks and incremental load edge cases — critical for production pipelines. |
| CORRECTNESS | 7 | All referenced validation patterns are real and applicable. The one broken reference (`schema-types.md`) is a quality concern but doesn't indicate incorrect claims. |
| USABILITY | 7 | Quick Start is useful. Navigation between SKILL.md and modules is smooth. The empty examples directory is a significant usability gap — users need a worked example. |
| ROBUSTNESS | 8 | Anti-patterns section is strong. Handles schema evolution, backwards compatibility, and partial validation failure. Missing: network timeout handling for remote schema fetches. |

**Expert subtotal: (8+6+7+7+8)/5 = 7.2**

---

### Judge 2: Critic

**Role:** Identifies gaps, weaknesses, anti-patterns, and edge cases.
**Calibration:** Strict — intentionally scores conservative to surface issues.

| Dimension | Score | Critic Commentary |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| METHODOLOGY | 6 | The protocol works for simple schemas but collapses under nested/recursive schema structures. Step 4 (constraint validation) assumes a flat schema model. No guidance on when to abort vs. continue validation after first failure. |
| DEPTH | 5 | No coverage of: streaming data validation, schema registry integration (Confluent, AWS Glue), or multi-source join validation. The "data types" coverage only addresses SQL types — no Avro, Parquet, or Arrow type systems. |
| CORRECTNESS | 6 | The placeholder `[INSERT SCHEMA PATH HERE]` in modules/validate.md (line 23) is a clear correctness failure — the skill was shipped incomplete. The claim about "99.9% detection rate" on line 31 has no source. |
| USABILITY | 5 | Zero examples is a dealbreaker for a validation skill. Users cannot learn by example. The broken reference creates a dead end. Anti-patterns section, while good, is buried at the end — should appear earlier as a pre-check. |
| ROBUSTNESS | 6 | Handles the happy path and common failures. No coverage of: what to do if the target system is unavailable, concurrent validation conflicts, or validation against evolving schemas mid-run. |

**Critic subtotal: (6+5+6+5+6)/5 = 5.6**

---

### Judge 3: Completeness Auditor

**Role:** Checks structure, coverage, cross-references, and actionability.
**Calibration:** Neutral — focuses on structural completeness, not quality of content.

| Dimension | Score | Auditor Commentary |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| METHODOLOGY | 7 | All required sections present in SKILL.md. Module structure follows conventions. Decision flow between modules is documented. Protocol steps are numbered and sequential. |
| DEPTH | 6 | 3 modules present: validate.md, report.md, fix-suggestions.md — reasonable coverage. However, no module for schema-registry integration or configuration management, which the skill description implies are supported. |
| CORRECTNESS | 6 | 2 structural correctness failures found: (1) broken reference to schema-types.md, (2) placeholder text in validate.md. These are Layer 0 failures that reached Layer 2 — the skill was not fully completed before evaluation. |
| USABILITY | 7 | Navigation is clear. Table of contents in SKILL.md maps correctly to modules. Quick Start section provides 2 invocation examples. Dependencies section complete. Loses points for missing examples. |
| ROBUSTNESS | 7 | Anti-patterns section documents 6 patterns. Failure modes section in validate.md covers 4 scenarios. Abort conditions defined. Minor gap: no documentation of what constitutes a "critical" vs. "warning" validation finding. |

**Auditor subtotal: (7+6+6+7+7)/5 = 6.6**

---

### Aggregated Scores (Weighted)

**Formula:** Expert (×0.4) + Critic (×0.3) + Auditor (×0.3)

| Dimension | Expert | Critic | Auditor | Weighted Score | Bar |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|----------------|-----|
| METHODOLOGY | 8 | 6 | 7 | 7.1 | `███████░░░` |
| DEPTH | 6 | 5 | 6 | 5.7 | `█████▒░░░░` |
| CORRECTNESS | 7 | 6 | 6 | 6.4 | `██████░░░░` |
| USABILITY | 7 | 5 | 7 | 6.4 | `██████░░░░` |
| ROBUSTNESS | 8 | 6 | 7 | 7.1 | `███████░░░` |
| **OVERALL** | **7.2** | **5.6** | **6.6** | **6.5** | `██████▒░░░` |

**Bar legend:** `█` = full point, `▒` = half point, `░` = empty

**Overall weighted score: 6.5 / 10**
**Pass threshold: 7.0**
**Status: BELOW THRESHOLD**

---

### Disagreement Analysis

> Flag trigger: any dimension where `max - min > 3` across judges.

| Dimension | Max | Min | Range | Disagreement Flag |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|-------------------|
| METHODOLOGY | 8 | 6 | 2 | None |
| DEPTH | 6 | 5 | 1 | None |
| CORRECTNESS | 7 | 6 | 1 | None |
| USABILITY | 7 | 5 | **2** | None (under threshold of 3) |
| ROBUSTNESS | 8 | 6 | 2 | None |

**No disagreement flags triggered.** Maximum range across all dimensions was 2 (USABILITY), below the trigger threshold of 3. Meta-judge not required.

**Interpretation:** The judges are aligned in their assessment. The Critic's USABILITY score of 5 reflects the empty examples directory — a structural deficiency all judges identified, but weighed differently. The Expert and Auditor judged the existing structure more charitably; the Critic penalized the missing examples more severely. This spread is within normal calibration variance.

---

### Meta-Judge Status

**Triggered:** NO
**Reason:** All dimension ranges within tolerance (max range: 2, threshold: 3)
**Action:** Proceed with weighted aggregation as final score.

---

## Top Improvements

Priority ordered by weighted impact on overall score.

### Priority 1 — Add a worked example (Impact: HIGH)
**Failing checks:** SK-10, Layer 1 suggestion 1, Critic USABILITY: 5, Auditor USABILITY: 7
**What to fix:** Create `examples/validate-postgres-to-s3.md` showing a complete validation run of a realistic PostgreSQL-to-S3 ETL pipeline: input schema, validation output, error report, and fix suggestions.
**Expected score improvement:** USABILITY +1.5 to +2.0 points

### Priority 2 — Create missing `references/schema-types.md` (Impact: HIGH)
**Failing checks:** U-07, SK-08, Critic CORRECTNESS: 6
**What to fix:** Create the referenced file with a type mapping table covering SQL, Avro, Parquet, and Arrow type systems. Remove the broken link if out of scope.
**Expected score improvement:** CORRECTNESS +0.8, DEPTH +0.5

### Priority 3 — Remove placeholder text (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Failing checks:** U-04, Critic CORRECTNESS: 6
**What to fix:** Replace `[INSERT SCHEMA PATH HERE]` in `modules/validate.md` line 23 with a concrete example path or a proper `$ARGUMENTS` reference.
**Expected score improvement:** CORRECTNESS +0.3

### Priority 4 — Expand depth for non-SQL type systems (Impact: MEDIUM)
**Failing checks:** Critic DEPTH: 5, Expert DEPTH: 6
**What to fix:** Add a module section or reference covering Avro, Parquet, and Arrow schemas. Add a note on schema registry integration (AWS Glue Data Catalog, Confluent Schema Registry).
**Expected score improvement:** DEPTH +1.0 to +1.5

### Priority 5 — Clarify critical vs. warning severity levels (Impact: LOW)
**Failing checks:** Auditor ROBUSTNESS partial
**What to fix:** Add a severity matrix to the validation output format — define which validation failures are CRITICAL (block pipeline) vs. WARNING (log and continue).
**Expected score improvement:** ROBUSTNESS +0.3
